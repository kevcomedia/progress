# 2018

The goal is to learn computer science subjects: algorithms, data structures and
the like. I'm also throwing in some maths, particularly discrete mathematics. I
also need to acquire web dev skills, so I'm doing coding projects as well.

## Rules

- Always be working on one course/project.
- Add bonus objectives from the bonus list as often as desired.
- All assignments must be completed for course to be considered complete.
