# January 28 (Sunday) Did-List

* Khan Academy (World of Math)
* Notes - YDKJS: this & Object Prototypes

## Notes

It's Sunday, so I decided to chill a little bit.

On today's quest to reconfig my vim, I discovered the
[Hack fonts](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/). It's a pretty monospace font
which is neat to look at.

I also discovered Prettier's new `prose-wrap` option, which makes typing
markdown a more pleasant experience for me. I'll just type away some markdown
and hit the keystrokes to run Prettier and BAM! Neat 80-char-wide markdown!

I also compiled my [notes](../../notes/28_this-and-object-prototypes.md) for
_this & Object Prototypes_. Unlike my previous notes, which are more like a
hacked together glossary of terms, this one's more of a proper summary. Though
doing it in one sitting might not be ideal. I should put these notes together in
smaller more frequent increments. I decided to give myself 15 points for putting
it together, since it's a pretty substantial write up IMO.
