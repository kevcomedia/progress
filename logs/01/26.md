# January 26 (Friday) Did-List

* Khan Academy
* Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction
* You Don't Know JS: this & Object Prototypes (chapters 3 to 5)
* Voting App (authentication)

## Notes

*this & Object Prototypes* is a dense book. The chapter on objects alone is
packed with stuff about, well, objects. And that's not touching prototypes yet.

I think I got the authentication part of the voting app working. I also like how
it turned out, though I might be trying to refactor things too early.

Some highlights:
* I made the [auth controller](https://github.com/kevcomedia/voting-app/blob/bc161a6285d95915268f183f809eee6ef6e53d38/controllers/auth.js)
  leaner by letting the User model [do the user-related tasks](https://github.com/kevcomedia/voting-app/blob/bc161a6285d95915268f183f809eee6ef6e53d38/models/user.js#L29).
* [Promisifying](https://github.com/kevcomedia/voting-app/blob/bc161a6285d95915268f183f809eee6ef6e53d38/controllers/auth.js#L74)
  a Promise-incompatible function (maybe it was?) was satisfying.
* My tests [look sloppy](https://github.com/kevcomedia/voting-app/blob/bc161a6285d95915268f183f809eee6ef6e53d38/test/user.js).
