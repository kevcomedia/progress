- Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction (Counting exercises)
- Voting App

## Notes

I finished all of the exercises on advanved counting today. There was a bonus
problem which I could not solve. The problem asked for a general formula for the
number of derangements of `n` items. I was able to solve that, but I couldn't
solve the approximate fraction of permutations that are derangements with the
Taylor series (the bonus problem). I used a calculator and determined it to be
around `0.37`, but that's it.

I also encountered an interesting thought while I was doing this problem:

> Given 6 presents, how many ways can you swap the name labels such that 5 of
> the presents keep their labels?

The solution is to choose 1 item to derange. Following what I learned, there are
`1! - 0!(1 choose 1) = 0` ways to derange a collection of 1 item. Which makes
sense. You can't derange a one-item collection. That item is always in its
proper place. This is an extension of the fact that a one-item collection is
always sorted. Therefore there's no way you can swap the labels such that 5 of
them keep their labels.

Next up in the book is a chapter summary and review: more than 4 pages of
exercises! I'm not sure I can do all that tomorrow. I'll probably do half next
time.

Also worked on the voting app. I tried making the authentication bits more
RESTful. I'm not really sure I understand what it means to be RESTful, but I'm
making it so that most requests are in JSON. I also think that my current setup
is hard to test. Speaking of which, I haven't set up any test at all. Also
linter rules.
