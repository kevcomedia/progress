# January 27 (Saturday) Did-List

* Khan Academy (Summarizing quantitative data)
* Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction
* You Don't Know JS: this & Object Prototypes (finished)

## Notes

I flunked the quiz about interquartile ranges and standard deviations. To get
the interquartile range, you sort the data set and divide it into two (if the
data set has an odd number of data, exclude the median). Get the median of each
half, then get the difference. I'm not sure what the IQR is for, but I guess
it's a measure of variance?

I can't ever remember how to get the standard deviation of a population or
sample, but I do remember that when getting the standard deviation of a sample,
you'll divide by the number of data points minus one. I don't recall why this is
so, but I remember watching on KA the intuition behind it.

I made a Fibonacci-like sequence generator in JS: https://repl.it/@kevcomedia/FibLike

I finished reading _this & Object Prototypes_! According to Pomello, I spent 20
üçÖ on the book. That doesn't count a couple of distractions (because of
unexpected chores and stuff) and uncounted reading time. I'll compile my notes
later. I might also do it differently, covering mostly the high points.

I switched to a different terminal emulator, just because. After all this time
using the terminal with Fira Mono font, seeing the default Monospace font feel
refreshing. I might stick with the font for a while.

And I really need more sleep.
