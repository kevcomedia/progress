# January 19 (Friday) Did-List

- Khan Academy (exercises)
- Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction (exercises)
- Anatomy of an HTTP Transaction from the Node.js website (reading)
- YKDJS: Up and Going (reading)

## Notes

So far all I've been doing on Khan Academy is to do a couple of exercises. I'm
still thinking which parts I should review. Probably the statistics module.

I'm nearing the end of the *Counting* chapter from the discrete math book. Just
one more set of exercises, then the chapter summary and review. I'll be the
master of counting soon >:)

I also read the first half of
[*Anatomy of an HTTP Transaction*](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/anatomy-of-an-http-transaction/)
from the Node.js website. Although I think I'll rarely create an HTTP server
from scratch with Node (since Express can do the dirty work), knowing what I can
do with stuff such as the `request` and `response` objects can be useful. Also
knowing the underlying concepts won't hurt.

I'm doing another round of YDKJS reading, so I'm picking up *Up and Going*. Even
though it's the third time I'm reading it, I still have trouble interpreting the
instructions for the practice problem at the end of the first chapter. My
attempt was close to the solution though. Here's a working gist:

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to spend time on the voting app :( . I'm thinking
of finishing it within the next week. Bootstrap 4 is also fresh out of beta, so
I might incorporate it as well.
