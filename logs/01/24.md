# January 24 (Wednesday) Did-List

* Khan Academy (marginal distribution and conditional distribution)
* Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introductions (remaining chapter review
  exercises)
* You Don't Know JS: this & Object Prototypes (chapters 1 and 2)
* Authentication with JWT Rabbit Hole

## Notes

The counting chapter is finished! No, I didn't become a master of counting,
because I had a couple of incorrect answers on the chapter review. Also, the
topics presented are just a subset of the entire subject of counting, called
enumerative counting, if I recall correctly.

Started *this & Object Prototypes* today. At the top of my head I can recall the
following:

* `this` doesn't refer to the function it's in, nor does it refer to the
  function's lexical scope.
* `this`-binding is determined entirely by the function's call site. The
  call-site can be determined by inspecting the source code, or by inspecting
  the call-stack on a debugger (more reliable).
* Default binding. For plain function calls, `this` is bound to the global
  object. If the function is in strict mode, `this` is `undefined`.
* Implicit binding. For function calls with a context object (e.g.,
  `obj.foo()`), `this` is bound to that context object.
* Explicit binding. For function calls using `call` or `apply`, `this` is bound
  to the object passed to those methods.
  * Hard binding. Form of explicit binding where the binding is super explicit.
    The `bind` method does hard binding.
* `new` binding. For function calls with the `new` operator, `this` is bound to
  the new object created by that call.
* Explicit binding is more precedent than implicit binding.
* `new` binding is more precedent that implicit binding.
* `new` binding is more precedent than the `bind` method's binding (I'm not sure
  if I remembered it right)
* If `null` or `undefined` is passed to `call` or `apply`, default binding
  happens. This is usually done if we don't care about the function's `this`
  binding.
  * This can be dangerous if the function has `this` in it, since the function
    call might then mutate the global object.
    * You can pass a throwaway empty object (which is not prototype-linked to
      `Object.prototype`) as a sort of "DMZ" so it's what gets mutated and the
      global object is spared.

The more I read about authentication with JWT, the more questions pop in my
head. What if the token expires while the user is still "logged in"? How can the
user make their token invalid (i.e., how can they log out)?

I got my Chingu Voyage email!
