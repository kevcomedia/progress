## Notes

Trouble with analyzing trends in categorical data

I don't feel so well today. My mind was drifting to a faraway place, so much
that I actually got a 0% on the categorical data trends quiz. I also wasn't able
to finish the last counting chapter exercises from the discrete maths book.

Still I managed to finish the rest of *Scope & Closures*. But I couldn't work on
the voting app :(
