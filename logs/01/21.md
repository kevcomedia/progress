# January 21 (Sunday) Did-List

* Khan Academy (World of Math)
* YDKJS: Up and Going (finished)
* Voting App (started writing tests)

## Notes

I finished reading _Up and Going_. Yay 200 points! On a more serious note, I
made notes on a piece of sketchbook paper. [Notes are here](../../notes/01/21_up-and-going.md).

Meanwhile I added tests on my voting app. I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.
Take a look: <https://gist.github.com/kevcomedia/777b66cb3bbc466286b3fd3259d93991>.
I wonder if there's a comprehensive guide to tests out there.

I'm thinking of picking up LaTeX. Maybe? Maybe not?
