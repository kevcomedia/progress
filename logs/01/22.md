# January 22 (Monday) Did-List

* Khan Academy (Analyzing one categorical variable)
* Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction (Counting chapter review)
* YDKJS: Scope & Closures (Chapters 1 - 3)
* Read about authentication with JSON Web Tokens

## Notes

So I started hitting the Statistics playlist again on Khan Academy. It looks
like new content has been added since the last time I was watching that
playlist. The more involved parts are still a bit far away, but we'll get there.

The discrete math exercises are fun. Even though the chapter is about counting,
and there are a handful of formulas you can use to count, most of the time I
ended up writing explanations on why a certain formula is used. Probably because
a good bit of the questions actually tell you to do explanations.

I started reading *Scope & Closures*. I'll transfer the notes I have so far from
paper to markdown later.

Here's the "conversation" I came up with for the scope lookup quiz:

The code snippet for reference:

```javascript
function foo(a) {
	var b = a;
	return a + b;
}

var c = foo( 2 );
```

> Engine: Hey Scope, I need an RHS lookup for `foo`. Know him?
>
> Scope: Yeah sure. He's a function.
>
> Engine: Alright. Executing `foo`
>
> Engine: Hey Scope, I need an LHS lookup for `a`.
>
> Scope: Uh huh. He's a parameter for `foo`. Here you go.
>
> Engine: Alright, assigning `2` to `a`.
>
> Engine: Uhm, Scope, I need an RHS lookup for `a`. I've a feeling I've seen him
>   before, but memory's hazy.
>
> Scope: Yeah sure, Here's `a`.
>
> Engine: Thanks bud. Oh, so `a` has the value `2`.
>
> Engine: Now I need an LHS lookup for `b`.
>
> Scope: Here, he's declared as a variable in `foo`.
>
> Engine: Okay, now I'm assigning what I got from `a` to `b`.
>
> Engine: Scope, friend, I need an RHS lookup for `a`. I'm really sorry about
> this, but I forget these things quickly...
>
> Scope: I feel you. Here you go.
>
> Engine: Yeah thanks. `2` is stored in `a`, huh.
>
> Engine: Hey, I also need an RHS lookup for `b`.
>
> Scope: Found him. Here you go.
>
> Engine: Hey, he's also got the same value.
>
> Engine: I'm adding them now.
>
> Engine: Then return.
>
> Engine: Hey Scope, I need an LHS lookup for `c`. This sum I got needs to go
> somewhere.
>
> Scope: Here you go, declared in the global space.
>
> Engine: Neat. Now assigning the sum `4` to `c`.

For the voting app, I decided that the current authentication system that I have
is not suitable for a RESTful API. I learned that RESTful APIs don't really have
a concept of usernames and passwords. If one insisted on using them, the user
will end up having to pass those credentials with every request to the API,
which is not ideal. So I turned my head towards JSON Web Tokens. Which means the
time I spent on reading on how to do authentication with `passport-local` has
become not-so useful.
