# February 12 (Monday) Did-List

* Khan Academy
* CS50 Speedrun start

## Notes

Excluding the final project, I think I can do CS50 in a week. Today I did Week 0
and Week 1 and their respective problem sets. This is what I did in Scratch for
pset0: <https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/203468265/>. It's basically a shooter
game. I couldn't implement the enemies actually shooting bullets, so I just made
it rain bullets from random directions.
