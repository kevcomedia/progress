# February 2 (Friday) Did-List

* Khan Academy (Summarizing quantitative data unit test)
* Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction (Polynomial fitting)
* Learn to Code HTML & CSS (chapters 7 to 10)

## Notes

I thought I could finish _Learn to Code_ today. I might also be spending a bit
more time doing write-ups. I don't know...

I also started trying to switch from tabs to buffers in Vim. And the Ctrl-P
plugin is fantastic!
