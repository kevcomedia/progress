# February 6 (Tuesday) Did-List

* Khan Academy (density curves)
* Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction (recurrence relations)
* Material Resume clone

## Notes

So that whole black magic thing to solve a recurrence relation is actually
detailed in the next chapter.

For the first time ever I used CSS Grid in a project. No wait, I think I used it
before. Anyway I used it for the Hobbies section of the resume. After watching
the CSS Grid video linked at the bottom of Firefox's new tab page, I'm now
tempted to redo the whole layout with Grid.
