# February 5 (Monday) Did-List

* Khan Academy (percentile and z-scores)
* Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction
* Material Resume clone

## Notes

Percentiles and z-scores are things I always forget (especially z-scores). A
data point is in the nth percentile if it's greater than (or equal to sometimes)
n% of the data. Z-score is the "distance" of a data point from the mean in
standard deviations. A z-score of 1.8 means the data point is 1.8 standard
deviations away from the mean. Negative values mean the value is below the mean.

So I was doing this exercise from the discrete math book:

> Consider the sequence 2, 5, 12, 29, 70, 169, 408, ... (with a<sub>0</sub> =
> 2). Find a closed formula for the sequence.

(math notation incoming; I don't know if these will render in GitHub markdown)

This is the last exercise for the polynomial fitting chapter. However I can't do
it with polynomial fitting, since the sequence doesn't seem to be
&Delta;<sup>k</sup>-constant (if a sequence is &Delta;<sup>k</sup>-constant,
then that sequence has a sequence of differences that consists of only the same
number; also such a sequence has a polynomial as its closed formula; 0, 1, 3, 6,
10, 15, ... is one such sequence, because its sequence of differences is 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, ..., and the sequence of differences of that is 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...,
making it a &Delta;<sup>2</sup>-constant sequence, and as such, the closed form
of that sequence is a quadratic polynomial). In fact it looks like some
variation of the Fibonacci sequence, which I didn't know the closed formula of.
12 is 2\*5 + 2, 29 is 2\*12 + 5, 70 is 2\*29 + 12, and so on. Each term is
double the previous plus the term before that. At wit's end, I looked up how to
find the closed formula for recursive sequences. Then I found
[this answer](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1426247) and tried it. I got a
clunky-looking exponential function with square roots of 2 and fraction bars
(which I don't think I can write in markdown; that's partly the reason why I was
considering picking up LaTeX). When I tried plugging in numbers to that
exponential, to my amazement, it churned out the original sequence! I was like,
"What black magic is this!?"

Enough math...

I did some
[progress](https://github.com/kevcomedia/material-resume-clone/tree/884ed3dff46ead35d7f3bfa6c18ee3d2296aadd3/src)
on the Material Resume clone, with some reading about BEM methodology. My
initial strategy was to use elements with a set `max-width` so the content of
the entire page line up nicely at the left and right gutters. However this
doesn't work well for the 2-column section, since each column has its own
background color. In the end I put a fixed padding on both sides, as much as I
don't like it. That means I'll have to do the same for the other elements where
I've set the `max-width`. For consistency and sanity.
