# February 11 (Sunday) Did-List

* Khan Academy (World of Math)
* Material Resume Clone (deployed!)

## Notes

I thought I'd be able to finish the clone in just three days, but it took me
more than five (excluding the days when I didn't code anything). I spent the
entire day making the thing responsive. Yesterday was entirely refactoring day.

So here are some things worth noting:

* Making responsive SVGs is not that straightforward. Mostly because of browser
  differences. It requires what's called the padding hack. The same hack is used
  to make responsive video embeds in Bootstrap.
* Because responsiveness was partly an afterthough (only the default design is
  available, so the resposive parts I had to come up with myself, after the
  defaut design was done), I think I ended up butchering my "perfect" (no, not
  really) BEM code.
* Apparently the page looks nice in a lot of browsers (yay!), save Edge and that
  weird instance where the SVGs look weird in Opera 50. See the issues for more.
* I actually wanted to make a walkthrough and post it in the forum or something.
